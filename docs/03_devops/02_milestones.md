## Risk Mitigation & Known Issues

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ **Docker Compose version compatibility:** Migrated to v2 syntax
- ✅ **Environment variable conflicts:** Implemented override system
- ✅ **Port conflicts:** All services use unique ports
- ✅ **Data loss on restart:** Persistent volumes implemented
- ✅ **Service startup dependencies:** Wait-for-it scripts implemented

### Current Risks
- 🔄 **Goose migration transition:** Requires backend developer coordination
- 🔄 **Production secret management:** Needs secure secret handling for prod
- 🔄 **Email service transition:** Development to production SMTP switch

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Database migrations:** Goose integration commands prepared, migration path documented
- **Secret management:** Environment override system supports secure production configs
- **Email transition:** Environment-based SMTP configuration supports both dev and prod
