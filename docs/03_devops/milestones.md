# Milestone: DevOps Infrastructure

**ID**: MILE-DEVOPS-001  
**Status**: done  
**Last updated**: 2025-09-22

## Goal

Establish complete local development environment with Docker Compose supporting all trading bot services, monitoring, and development tools.

## Success criteria

- Complete infrastructure deployable with single `make up` command
- All 9 services operational with health checks
- Development workflow supports hot reload for code changes
- Database and cache persistence between restarts
- Monitoring and observability tools functional
- Email testing capabilities integrated
- Documentation comprehensive and current

## Included tasks

- [x] TASK-DEVOPS-001 — Core infrastructure setup (done)
- [x] TASK-DEVOPS-002 — Database and storage configuration (done)  
- [x] TASK-DEVOPS-003 — Development tools and workflow (done)
- [x] TASK-DEVOPS-004 — Monitoring and observability (done)
- [x] TASK-DEVOPS-005 — Documentation and validation (done)
- [x] TASK-DEVOPS-006 — Docker Compose modernization (done)

## Risks / blockers

- Database migration transition — requires backend developer coordination to integrate Goose
- Production secret management — development environment uses plain text secrets
- Email service transition — development uses Mailpit, production needs real SMTP
