   - Apply consistent theming to charts

2. **TASK-FRONTEND-004**: Routing and Layout System
   - Set up React Router v6 with lazy loading
   - Create responsive layout components
   - Implement navigation patterns

### Future Component Additions
When needed for specific features, consider adding:
- Tabs, Progress, Tooltip (TASK-FRONTEND-004 onwards)
- DropdownMenu, Command, Form (API Key Management - TASK-FRONTEND-006)
- Switch, Checkbox, RadioGroup (Strategy Configuration - TASK-FRONTEND-009)

## Risk Assessment ✅

### Potential Issues Mitigated
- ✅ **Mobile Performance**: Components are lightweight and optimized
- ✅ **Theme Consistency**: Centralized CSS variables prevent color conflicts
- ✅ **Bundle Size**: Only essential components implemented, tree-shaking enabled
- ✅ **Browser Compatibility**: Radix UI ensures cross-browser support
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance implemented

### Technical Debt: None
All components follow established patterns and best practices. No technical debt incurred.
